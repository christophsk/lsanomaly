\caption{Results of anomaly detection on static data (average AUC after stratified $k$-fold validation).
{\emph{LSAD}}
denotes least square anomaly detection,
{\emph{OCSVM}} denotes the one-class support vector machine,
{\emph{KNN}} denotes $k$-nearest
neighbor, and
{\emph{KM}} denotes $k$-means. Where there is a unique maximal average AUC value, it is indicated in bold.
Italics indicate results which were not significantly different from the best scoring method according to a
paired t-test at significance level $p = 0.05$.}
